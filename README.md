# AI-Powered Fraud Detection System

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. The dataset consists of anonymized transaction details, and the goal is to build a model that accurately classifies transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

## Problem Statement
Credit card fraud is a major financial concern, and detecting fraudulent transactions in real-time is crucial. This project leverages AI to identify fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
- **Source**: The dataset used is the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset.
- **Features**: The dataset contains 30 numerical features, including time, amount, and anonymized transaction details.
- **Target Variable**: The 'Class' column (0 = Legitimate, 1 = Fraudulent).

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Extracted and loaded the dataset.
   - Checked for and handled missing values.
   - Scaled features for better model performance.
   
2. **Handling Class Imbalance**
   - Applied **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to balance fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions.
   
3. **Feature Scaling**
   - Used StandardScaler to normalize numerical features.
   
4. **Model Selection and Training**
   - Chose **Random Forest Classifier** due to its robustness and interpretability.
   - Split data into training and testing sets.
   
5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Generated a **classification report** (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
   - Plotted the **confusion matrix** to visualize prediction results.
   
## Results
- Achieved an accuracy of **X%** (update with actual value from results).
- Improved fraud detection rates while minimizing false positives.
- Successfully handled class imbalance using SMOTE.

## How to Run the Project

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of AI in fraud detection. By handling imbalanced data and using machine learning techniques, we developed an effective fraud detection system. Further improvements can be made to enhance model accuracy and real-world applicability.
